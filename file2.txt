Threading in Python is often misunderstood.  
Because of the Global Interpreter Lock, threads do not run CPU heavy code in parallel.  
However, they shine when tasks involve waiting, such as network requests or file operations.  
By overlapping these waits, threading improves responsiveness and throughput.  
In practice, engineers combine threading with multiprocessing to balance I/O and CPU workloads.
