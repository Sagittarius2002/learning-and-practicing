# Objective:
# Build a threaded program that counts the number of words in multiple large text files concurrently.
# Details:
# - You are given a list of file paths (say 5â€“10 large .txt files).
# - Write a function count_words(file_path) that opens a file, reads its contents, and returns the word count.
# - Use threading to launch one thread per file so that multiple files are processed at the same time.
# - Collect the results in a shared dictionary like:
# {
#     "file1.txt": 12345,
#     "file2.txt": 6789,
#     ...
# }
# -
# - Use a threading.Lock to ensure safe updates to the shared dictionary.
# - Print the total word count across all files at the end
