Data engineering is both an art and a science. Pipelines must be reliable, scalable, and efficient. A single broken transformation can ripple through dozens of downstream systems. Engineers therefore design with resilience in mind, adding monitoring, logging, and alerts. The craft is not only about moving data but also about shaping it into a form that empowers analytics and machine learning.
